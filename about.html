        <div id="p1"> <p id="paragraph1"> I am a soon to be sophomore at Science Leadership Academy. I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 15th, 2003. I am the oldest of two children. I am currently apart of my school’s robotics team and CTE engineering program. I went to Cedar Grove Christian academy for elementary and middle school. I also graduated with all A’s and multiple awards.I am a scholar at SMASH Wharton. I am here at SMASH since I love to do STEM activities and collaborate with people. My group and I are trying to find a solution to Meningitis. We are hoping to spread awareness about Meningitis. </p>
